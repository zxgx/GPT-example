{"text":"A magazine supplement with an image of Adolf Hitler and the title 'The Unreadable Book' is pictured in Berlin. No law bans \u201cMein Kampf\u201d in Germany, but the government of Bavaria, holds the copyright and guards it ferociously. (Thomas Peter\/REUTERS)\n\nThe city that was the center of Adolf Hitler\u2019s empire is littered with reminders of the Nazi past, from the bullet holes that pit the fronts of many buildings to the hulking Luftwaffe headquarters that now house the Finance Ministry.\n\nWhat it doesn\u2019t have, nor has it since 1945, are copies of Hitler\u2019s autobiography and political manifesto, \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d in its bookstores. The latest attempt to publish excerpts fizzled this week after the Bavarian government challenged it in court, although an expurgated copy appeared at newspaper kiosks around the country.\n\nBut in Germany \u2014 where keeping a tight lid on Hitler\u2019s writings has become a rich tradition in itself \u2014 attitudes toward his book are slowly changing, and fewer people are objecting to its becoming more widely available.\n\nNo law bans \u201cMein Kampf\u201d in Germany, but the government of Bavaria, where Hitler officially resided at the time of his 1945 suicide, holds the copyright and guards it ferociously. German-language copies that were printed before 1945 are legal, although they command a premium price, and the book is available in translation elsewhere in the world.\n\nBut the question of whether to publish it in the country where Hitler plotted his empire has lost some of its edge in the Google era, when a complete German-language copy of the book pops up as the second result on the local version of the search engine.\n\n\u201cTo say this is a very dangerous book, we must ban it, this is ridiculous,\u201d said Wolfgang Wippermann, a professor of modern history at the Free University of Berlin. \u201cMaybe it was necessary once, but now it\u2019s over, it makes no sense. You can find it so easily.\u201d\n\nThe publisher of the excerpts, London-based Albertus, has said it will appeal the Bavarian government\u2019s injunction. In 2009, the publisher beat charges of copyright violation and the illegal use of Nazi symbols after the Bavarian government seized reprinted copies of the Nazi Party\u2019s in-house newspaper.\n\nThe attempt to publish portions of \u201cMein Kampf\u201d on Thursday was scuttled at the last moment, although the publisher, ready to capitalize on the publicity, had printed two versions of the pamphlet. The version propped on top of a heap of celebrity magazines at a newsstand in Berlin\u2019s central Friedrichstrasse station was a slender, blue, 16-page leaflet that has historical commentary in one column and an image of blurred text stamped with \u201cUnreadable\u201d in the other, accompanied by two reproductions of Nazi-era newspapers.\n\n\u201cMein Kampf\u201d \u201cis an awful book, and the whole thinking is absolutely not ours, but we have another view on it regarding the idea of packing it away. This idea is just naive,\u201d said Alexander Luckow, a spokesman for the publisher. \u201cIn a free country, you need to discuss these very bad parts of German history.\u201d\n\nStill, he said, there are limits, and using Hitler\u2019s words as inspiration, not as historical artifact, is where it crosses the line.\n\n\u201cThe danger is allowing right-wing people to sell it in bookshops with their modern commentary,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is forbidden and it\u2019s good . . . not only in Germany, this should be equal in other countries in Europe. Anti-Semitism is not confined to Germany. You look and it\u2019s all around Europe, dating back to the Middle Ages.\u201d\n\nThe debate will soon be over, whether or not the latest excerpts make it to newsstands. German law extends copyright 70 years after the author\u2019s death; after 2015, \u201cMein Kampf\u201d will be fair game. Some in Bavaria\u2019s government worry that neo-Nazis will publish their own version of the book shortly thereafter, and to counter that, they are encouraging a scholarly edition. A group of historians is preparing it.\n\nGermany\u2019s Jewish organizations have approached the publication with mixed emotions, sensitive that their country still has problems with neo-Nazis and anti-Semitism. The German government released a study this week that found that one in five Germans has anti-Semitic attitudes. And a neo-Nazi ring that has been linked to at least nine killings before it was shut down in November shocked Germans who thought they had done a thorough job working through their past.\n\n\u201cI do very well without any publishing of \u2018Mein Kampf,\u2019 \u201d said Dieter Graumann, the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. \u201cIn a few years, it will be free, and I have every trust in the democratic maturity of the German people. . . . But for the moment, I am glad it is not.\u201d"}
{"text":"For today\u2019s post, I\u2019d like to take a look at California\u2019s voter initiative to legalize pot. If the measure passes, and the sky doesn\u2019t fall, many other states will probably be looking at similar law changes in the near future. Our drug policy of the last century has simply not worked, and it\u2019s heartening to see a state attempting to legalize marijuana.\n\nThe statistics on marijuana arrests are really shocking. According to the Drug Policy Alliance, which is in favor of legalization, blacks are arrested for marijuana possession between four and twelve times more than whites in California, even though studies have consistently shown that whites smoke more pot than blacks. In the last ten years, around 500,000 people have been arrested for possession. That\u2019s absurd! Think about how expensive that is for the criminal justice system. California spends $216,000 for each juvenile inmate in its prison system, yet it spends only $8,000 per student in the Oakland school system. It seems to me that if you really want to limit drug use, it\u2019d make more sense to spend more money keeping kids in school, helping them achieve.\n\nThe economic benefits of legalizing marijuana are mind blowing. If marijuana was legalized and taxed at the same rate of tobacco, the money we would save on law enforcement and gain in tax revenue equals about $17 billion. As Nicholas Kristof notes, that is enough money to send every three and four year old in a poor neighborhood to pre-school. Or we could spend that money improving public school education. Or we could use the money to shore up border defense. Whatever we do, $17 billion is not exactly a trivial amount.\n\nFor me, the biggest reason to legalize marijuana is to hurt the cartels. Immigration has emerged as a hot button issue recently, with Arizona passing a draconian immigration law and many similar propositions being considered by other states. People are worried about violence, and understandably so. No one wants to have foreign drug dealers operating in their back yard. But no matter how many laws we pass, or how much money we spend, marijuana from Mexico and other Latin American countries will always find a way across the border. Drug importers are smart, and the demand is so high that increased patrols by border agents and harsher prison sentences will not act as an effective deterrent. America will always have a demand for marijuana, and that means as long as the drug stays illegal, violent drug cartels will operate in our borders.\n\nBut what if the drug that the cartels are pushing is suddenly legal? No one in their right mind would buy pot off the street if they could instead walk into a dispensary and buy high quality marijuana legally, and probably for less money than the cartels are charging. Very few people actually want to have to hide their drug use. If given a choice, marijuana smokers would absolutely buy legal drugs. This would severely weaken the cartels, and decrease deaths related to drug trafficking.\n\nI\u2019m not advocating drug use here. I know people who have ruined their lives from excess drug use. But it\u2019s not true that marijuana is the gateway drug that people have been demonizing for years. Just because someone smokes pot every once in a while doesn\u2019t mean that person will turn around and become a heroin addict. Yes, marijuana intoxicates you, but so do legal drugs like alcohol. As long as sensible restrictions are built into the law, such as making it illegal to drive under the influence, then there is no reason that marijuana should not be legalized."}
{"text":"Anarchists in solidarity with the purged immigrants of Agios Panteleimonas ventured once again to open the public playground which is kept locked by fascists in favor of segregation, leading to battle with riot police and five arrests.\n\nOn Tuesday 9\/06 anarchists in solidarity to immigrants who are being daily terrorised by fascist thugs of the Golden Dawn neonazi party and their local allies in the area of Agios Panteleimonas, moved to unblock the entrance of the local children playground which the fascists want to keep locked in an effort to impose segregation between greeks and immigrants, and \"to preserve the blood purity of the white race\"...While unblocking the playground the anarchists were attacked by fascists who were soon routed before the arrival of riot police forces who engaged the anarchists in battle with the aim of protecting the fascists. During the clashes one policeman was injured and five protesters were arrested on criminal charges. After the end of the clashes, a local greek father, Mr Tasoulas, defying the reign of terror in the area, took his son to play in the coveted playground. Soon they were surrounded by fascists who blocked the exit of the playground and threatened to linch the father calling him a traitor. After he managed to handle the child to a sympathetic neighbor, the fascists beat the father in full presence of the chief of the local police station. The strong police forces present at the scene then arrested the father and took him to the local police station, where his solicitor, a leading figure of the legal world and human rights activist, was piled with eggs by fascists who threatened her life.\n\nThe new tension in the area comes after the euroelection ascent of LAOS, the fascist Popular Orthodox Alarm Party, to the 4th position with 7% of the vote. This in combination with the governing party's landslide defeat, has led the government to endorse the core of the extreme-right wing policies of LAOS, and pledge a mass sweeping operation against illegal immigrants and their greek supporters within the summer. As the concentration camp planned to be built in the old NATO airbase of Aspropyrgos is now deemed impractical, the government has committed several old military camps of disgraceful humanitarian standards around the capital for the purpose of \"cleaning the city of foreigners\". The measures and discourse comes as little surprise as it comes from a political party famous for wanting to displace homosexuals in desert islands in the late 1970s. Furthermore the \"Law and Order\" operation of the coming summer is said to also include a mass attack against anarchist squats, and solidarity actions to immigrants by the movement as a whole. This the government hopes to achieve via a virtual military occupation of the center of Athens for the summer months modeled on Olympics 2004, as well as the introduction of a disputed legislation that would eventually render protest marches illegal. Due to the lack of a legislative majority by one MP, the government has resorted to yet another legal trick by increasing the total number of MPs by one, non-elected member of its own liking for the summer session of the Parliament.\n\nThe dictatorial rule of the right-wing and the ruthless employment of its parastate agents is increasing the tension across the country. Last week one police station in Athens was attacked and a central tax office was bombed by a Marxist guerrilla group, while a series of luxury brothels frequented by the ruling class were destroyed. At the same time, the movement is on its guard in expectation of next Saturday's Gay Pride parade which last year was attacked by parastate fascist thugs, as well as in expectation of an evacuation of the old courts in down-town Athens which are occupied by immigrants and are a constant target by the bourgeois media who waste no time in supporting the fascists in a most unambiguous manner."}
{"text":"The 45-year-old \u201chighway shooter\u201d who engaged in a 12-minute shootout with California Highway Patrol officers earlier this year now says Fox News host Glenn Beck has been an inspiration for his activity.\n\nIn a several thousand word expose for MediaMatters, Pacifica journalist John Hamilton interviewed the so-called highway shooter, Byron Williams, from prison.\n\nIn the interview, Williams details what he saw as an elaborate global conspiracy and tells the journalist \u2014 whom he sees as his \u201cmedia advocate\u201d \u2014 to look to specific broadcasts of Beck\u2019s show for information on the conspiracy he describes. (MediaMatters says Beck\u2019s show provided \u201cinformation on the conspiracy theory that drove him over the edge: an intricate plot involving Barack Obama, philanthropist George Soros, a Brazilian oil company, and the BP disaster.\u201d)\n\nThe release on Hamilton\u2019s story explains that \u201cWilliams also points to other media figures \u2014 right-wing propagandist David Horowitz, and Internet conspiracist and repeated Fox News guest Alex Jones \u2014 as key sources of information to inspire his \u2018revolution.'\u201d\n\nWilliams is quoted as saying that \u201cBeck would never say anything about a conspiracy, would never advocate violence. He\u2019ll never do anything \u2026 of this nature. But he\u2019ll give you every ounce of evidence that you could possibly need.\u201d\n\n\u201cI collect information on corruption,\u201d Williams says, \u201cI\u2019ve been at it for some time.\u201d\n\nBeck, in particular, he says, is \u201clike a schoolteacher on TV.\u201d Williams reportedly told Hamilton, \u201cYou need to go back to June \u2014 June of this year, 2010 \u2014 and look at all his programs from June, and you\u2019ll see he\u2019s been breaking open some of the most hideous corruption.\u201d\n\nHamilton notes that extremism linked to anti-progressive propaganda is nothing new:\n\nConspiracy theory-fueled extremism has long been a reaction to progressive government in the United States. Half a century ago, historian Richard Hofstadter wrote that right-wing thought had come to be dominated by the belief that Communist agents had infiltrated all levels of American government and society. The right, he explained, had identified a \u201csustained conspiracy, running over more than a generation, and reaching its climax in Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, to undermine free capitalism, to bring the economy under the direction of the federal government, and to pave the way for socialism or communism.\u201d In a 2009 report, the Southern Poverty Law Center found that the anti-government militia movement \u2014 which had risen to prominence during the Clinton administration and faded away during the Bush years \u2014 has returned. According to the SPLC, the anti-government resurgence has been buttressed by paranoid rhetoric from public officials like Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann and media figures like Fox News\u2019 Glenn Beck. Just last month, Gregory Giusti pleaded guilty to repeatedly threatening House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 including threatening to destroy her California home \u2014 because he was \u201cupset with her passing the health care law.\u201d His mother told a local news station that he \u201cfrequently gets in with a group of people that have really radical ideas,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019d say Fox News or all of those that are really radical, and he \u2014 that\u2019s where he comes from.\u201d After the 2008 election, Fox News personalities filled the airwaves with increasingly violent rhetoric and apocalyptic language. On his Fox News show, Beck talked about \u201cput[ting] poison\u201d in Pelosi\u2019s wine.\n\nObservers of this most recent act were mystified by one of Byron Williams\u2019 reported targets: the Tides Foundation, a low-profile charitable organization known for funding environmentalists, community groups, and other organizations. Beck, it turned out, had attacked Tides 29 times on his Fox News show in the year-and-a-half leading up to the shooting.\n\nIn their writeup, The Huffington Post provided a video that detailed Williams\u2019 attack, as posted on YouTube.

{"text":"New drunk-driving law cracks down on 3rd DUI LEGISLATURE\n\nDrivers who are repeatedly caught drunk behind the wheel could lose their license for up to a decade under legislation signed by the governor Monday.\n\nThe measure by Assemblyman Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, allows judges to revoke a person's driver's license for up to 10 years if they have three or more convictions for driving under the influence within the prior decade. Currently, courts may only take away a repeat offender's driver's license for three years.\n\nThe law will take effect on Jan. 1, 2012.\n\nHill estimated that the measure could help take more than 10,000 repeat DUI offenders off the road each year. Nearly 188,000 DUI convictions were handed down around the state in 2008, he noted, with 9,164 of those drivers on their third conviction and 3,200 with four or more DUI offenses, Hill said.\n\n\"I urge judges across the state to use this new authority and take repeat DUI offenders off the road,\" Hill said in a statement.\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there are 1.5 million DUI arrests in California each year, and one-third of those arrested are repeat offenders. In total, more than 310,000 Californians have three or more DUI convictions, according to the agency.\n\n\"This legislation is an important step toward making California's roads safer,\" Republican Gov.

{"text":"While it\u2019s good to see that number of obese and overweight children has (slightly) fallen for those starting school, one in 10 children is still entering reception obese or overweight, rising to one in five at the start of secondary school.\n\nMore startlingly, the figures from the Health & Social Care Information Centre show that 25% of children in poorer areas are obese, compared to about 11% in more affluent areas. Let\u2019s absorb that disturbing fact \u2013 right now, Britain\u2019s poor children are more than twice as likely to be obese or overweight.\n\nResponses to these statistics have included calls for a ban on junk food advertising before the 9pm watershed, but is this really the most productive way forward?\n\nWhat if it\u2019s not so much about \u201cjunk food\u201d, as we define it, but, rather, that all too often these days the junk is the food and the food is the junk \u2013 and that sometimes, for people on tight budgets, this is all that\u2019s reasonably achievable?\n\nOnce poverty enters the equation, it\u2019s simply not about junk food as we understand it anymore. Say junk food and an image springs to mind of people allowing their children to scarf down crisps, sweets, and the now notorious fizzy drinks, or burgers, pizzas and fried chicken from overflowing buckets. The implication is that the problem lies with the treats and extras, consumed on top of real meals and that children are being overindulged, to the detriment of their health.\n\nHowever, this image of feckless, uncaring, underprivileged Britons encouraging their fat children to over-snack simply doesn\u2019t ring true, especially considering that these are households where, by definition, money is tight.\n\nOn the contrary, it seems obvious that the actual meals are contributing hugely to the problem \u2013 and that this is where austerity is having a terrifying and sustained impact.\n\nWhile healthy food is often prohibitively expensive, less healthy options are relatively as cheap as, well, chips. When parents have to find the cheapest food available for their family, it\u2019s nearly always going to be less likely to be fresh; more likely to be highly calorific (therefore \u201cfilling\u201d), as well as packed with additives whose addictive and metabolism-skewing properties should not be discounted.\n\nYou also have to factor in how exhausting poverty is. Often the last thing that stressed, skint parents need at the end of the day is to start a meal from scratch.\n\nThis is why, however well meant, the \u201cwhy not buy some veg from the local market and make a lovely stew?\u201d rationale so often takes on the shrill ring of Marie Antoinette\u2019s fabled suggestion about the poor eating cake.\n\nThat\u2019s the cruel thing about cooking. It\u2019s not all about \u201clazy proles\u201d and their lost culinary skills. Something that\u2019s a hobby, a stress release, in an affluent household, too easily becomes an extra source of tension in an impoverished one. Moreover, \u201creal\u201d cooking can be expensive \u2013 from the ingredients, and the herbs and spices, to the equipment, even the gas or electricity. Hence the microwave, the ripping open of the packet, the easier solution. Who\u2019s to judge? Plenty of people do.\n\nPerhaps it could be acknowledged that the very concept of junk food has become absurdly dated and misleading. That shifts in fundamental food culture (the creep of junk into normal meals) appear to be a much more profound problem than merely overindulging in signposted treats. Kids eating rubbish has always been with us but it is only now that the staples, the dietary cornerstones, are also unhealthy, that their weight problems are escalating. Nor is the problem confined to junk food advertising \u2013 if only it were that simple. Like with most things that become uncontrollable in life, money lies at the core. Poverty isn\u2019t only exhausting and limiting, it\u2019s also highly fattening.\n\nCoe did the right thing. But why did it take so long?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Better late than never. Sebastian Coe has walked away from his Nike contract. Photograph: Lionel Cironneau\/AP\n\nEven though Sebastian Coe has finally resigned from his \u00a3100,000-a-year role as Nike ambassador, he still insists that there was no conflict of interest with his position as president of the IAAF. Is he on another planet or am I?\n\nCoe\u2019s resignation doesn\u2019t prove that there was any wrongdoing, even with the email that surfaced relating to Eugene (birthplace of Nike) winning the right to stage the 2012 World Athletics Championships without others being allowed to bid. As things stand, Coe\u2019s conduct appears to have been above board. Nevertheless he has to stop this ludicrous sulking as if a big fuss is being made about nothing.\n\nThis is a prime example of a big fuss being made about\u2026 something. Obviously, it is not feasible for the president of IAAF simultaneously to be signed up as an ambassador to a major international sportswear company. Likewise, Coe\u2019s main argument concerning the longevity of his association with Nike (38 years) is resentful, entitled nonsense.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Coe to be philosophical. This was a blatant conflict of interest and the only mystery is how it wasn\u2019t dealt with when he became president earlier this year.\n\nLet Katie Hopkins damn herself\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Katie Hopkins: the face of unreason. Photograph: Dan Kennedy\/Discovery Communications\/Dan Ken\n\nIt seems as though every week now there is a terrible darkening of the skies as a giant candlesnuffer slams down over the flickering wick of free speech.\n\nThis time, it happened at Brunel University, where Katie Hopkins was spouting her usual informed, enlightened views on welfare. (Oh sorry, I went a bit funny there.)\n\nHopkins wasn\u2019t banned from speaking. Instead, just as she began to talk, a large bunch of students stood up, turned their backs on her and walked out of the hall. It was an action that was widely billed as a wonderful compromise protest, but it wasn\u2019t really.\n\nOf course it was better than banning \u2013 but only because anything is better than banning. It wasn\u2019t spontaneous, and therefore looked staged and just a little pompous. Nor, crucially, did it respect one of the foremost principles of free speech.\n\nFree speech is not just about someone being allowed to talk, it is also about them being properly heard and debated, and this holds true, even when that someone is as idiotic and offensive as Hopkins. Especially then.\n\nFor free speech to work, you have to let people speak first, and then challenge them via debate, which means no bans or, indeed, back-turnings and walk-outs.\n\nOtherwise, all that happens is that people such as Hopkins remain wedded to the delusion that they\u2019re fearless speakers of truth. Ideally, they should have their arguments brusquely shredded in a public forum.\n\nThe Brunel University walk-out was not a compromise protest, it was just a way of banning without actually banning. Everyone has to stop panicking and just allow people to be annoying bigots. Last time that I checked, the good people of Britain could cope."}

{"text":"What if I want to build everything in ClojureScript\n\nJiyinYiyong Blocked Unblock Follow Following May 31, 2017\n\nMany things have changed since I wrote this post, check out updates on shadow-cljs. That\u2019s might be promising.\n\nJavaScript is becoming more and more mature. For front-end, React\/Anguar\/Vue are capable of building middle-size or even large apps, with help of all kinds of components and libraries. Deploying webapps is never easier, Webpack has almost all the features we need. For backend, Node.js ecosystem has been evolving since 2009, we have Express and Koa, with all kinds of middlewares. No mention how many developers are participating in \u201crewriting everything in JavaScript\u201d.\n\nJavaScript is a messy world. Mixed language paradigms, inconsistent languages features, lots of innovations toward different and sometimes opposite directions. It\u2019s hard to get well with such an inconsistent programming language. However, it turned out people like to use it thanks to its successful ecosystem.\n\nClojureScript is in a different situation. We have faith in functional programming but there\u2019s not a large community to support it. Here\u2019s the problem in me. I want to build websites with only ClojureScript. How can I achieve that?\n\nFor front-end, ClojureScript libraries and components are relatively rare(or at least hard to find many of them on Google). Yes we can use use JavaScript libraries and components. However it\u2019s not always true. Take an example from React and Vue, which are both in JavaScript, but it\u2019s impractical to share components from each other. I saw people using React components in Reagent or Rum many times. I was convinced it\u2019s possible. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy since we may need so many components.\n\nFor backend it\u2019s worse. People are using Clojure to build web servers. Being a JavaScript developer there are lots of barriers if I want to pick up the whole Java ecosystem. Developing and debugging Clojure is a lot different from ClojureScript. And for web servers, the JavaScript community is throwing away expressing and going toward Koa with async\/await support, while in ClojureScript it\u2019s core.async , a lot different. We can still Google and find blogs and projects on using React components in ClojureScript, but it\u2019s fewer results for Node.js, besides, how about the framework and libraries? And I\u2019m not sure about the database part either.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to believe in ClojureScript. To see JavaScript developers using create-react-app, using Koa, although slowly but most aspects of developing are covered by people who went ahead. In using ClojureScript, I have to take every step very carefully, sometimes in debugging without SourceMaps on variables, sometimes worried about where to find guides and docs, sometimes anxious about people misunderstanding my work.\n\nI will still pick ClojureScript as the primary language for my personal projects. Also I\u2019m fully aware that it adds limits to me so someday I still need to pick up some other languages to finish my work. It will be my big problem in the near future. I already see it and it made me feel sad that I can only write fast in ClojureScript. ClojureScript has some unique features that help me finished Stack Editor and Cumulo, but also trapped me here. I do hope that I learnt ClojureScript I can program all things I need, it\u2019s always not true for any language.\n\nNow I have to consider what to do next. In the past years I built many toy apps, none of them reached the complexity of real-world products. I have to learn such ability. Bet on ClojureScript or another?"}

White will be joined by WSWS reporter Eric London, who will conduct the interview and field questions from autoworkers across the country. The interview will be broadcast at wsws.org\/autoworkers\/interview.\n\nThe battle by autoworkers in the United States has reached a critical juncture. After Fiat Chrysler workers overwhelmingly defeated the contract pushed by the United Auto Workers earlier this month, the UAW has brought back another deal crafted to meet the strategic aims of the auto corporations and Wall Street.\n\nNo matter what the spin the UAW\u2019s PR firm puts on it, the new deal, like the first, would accelerate the descent of autoworkers\u2014once among the highest-paid industrial workers in the world\u2014into the ranks of the working poor.\n\nThe challenges autoworkers face are immense, but the forces they can mobilize among workers and youth in the US and around the world are more powerful. To carry out a successful struggle, however, autoworkers who are leading this fight have to have a clear understanding of the economic and political forces that they confront.\n\nTo submit a question in advance of the interview, please register below.

{"text":"Don\u2019t raise your voice here.\n\nAngela Kabari Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jul 20, 2017\n\nMy name is Angela. I am the woman in the centre of the current Ushahidi sexual harassment scandal.\n\nThe past six months have been some of the most bizarre in my life and, on the balance, I think there is benefit in sharing my experience with the world so that lessons may be learned from it. It is my hope that, my story shall prompt a change in company policies, both in the Kenyan tech space and in other fields.\n\nI joined Ushahidi in September 2015 as a Capacity Development Officer for Making All Voices Count. My time there was mostly enjoyable: the work was challenging, the team was great, and the environment was liberal and progressive. All in all, a good place to be. Of course, everything was not perfect, but what organisation does not have issues and day-to-day frictions?\n\nThis changed on the morning of January 19th 2017, when Daudi Were, the Executive Director at Ushahidi asked me to have sex with a colleague, presumably for his own titillation. The events of that night left me troubled and confused. I knew that what had happened to me was not right, but I thought it was an isolated incident and decided to forget it and attempted to move on. (For details of this, see here my statement on the events of the night as well as a transcript of the audio. Some of the names in the transcript have been altered to protect the identities of my former colleagues. Aside from this, no other alterations have been made to it).\n\nI managed to do this for precisely one week after which I began to lose focus on my work. Over the next two weeks, I started to experience migraines whenever I went to the office. I did not want to leave my bed, yet I was sleeping poorly. I had experienced some periodic stomach upsets prior to and during the team retreat. However, after the retreat, these became worse and more frequent. At first, I thought that this was due to the upheaval that the Making All Voices Count programme was experiencing at the time due to international politics (it was negatively impacted by Brexit and changes in US presidency).\n\nI also thought that I might be physically ill so I sought professional advice from my doctor. I was diagnosed with a bacterial infection of the gut, but my doctor could not account for all my other symptoms. Upon his advice, I went to see a therapist who suggested some exercises to help me figure out what was wrong. I also took 3 weeks off from work from late February to mid-March as I thought I might be suffering from ordinary stress and burnout.\n\nIt was during this time off that I did the exercises prescribed by the therapist and I realised that my problem was psychosomatic. The distress from the incident in January had caught up with me, almost a month later. I had tried to pass off Daudi\u2019s remarks as drunkenness or joking but my body wasn\u2019t buying it. It was at this point that I decided to quietly resign; I still wasn\u2019t convinced that it was something I could or should raise with my employers.\n\nOnce I had made this decision in early March, I separately confided in two close friends that I was looking for a new job because I was uncomfortable with continuing to work at Ushahidi. When they asked why I was leaving, I shared with them some details of what had happened with Daudi. In the course of our conversations, I was stunned to learn that Daudi\u2019s comments were not the isolated incident I had assumed but rather that he had a years\u2019 long, widely-known reputation for sexually inappropriate conduct, socially and at work.\n\nAfter my leave was over, I began predominantly working from home, which thankfully was possible as Ushahidi allows remote working. I was going to the office only thrice a month on average and I timed my visits to the office to ensure that I would not have to run into Daudi. It was in early April, after a month of soul searching and conversations with three other women who had been on the receiving end of unwelcome attention from Daudi, that I came to the conclusion that something needed to be done. Unfortunately, I seemed to be the only person with both tangible evidence of his misconduct, as well as an employer-employee relationship. It is then that I sought legal advice and learned that, based on the provisions of Ushahidi\u2019s HR Manual, as well as Kenyan and Florida Law, Daudi\u2019s comments qualified as sexual harassment by creating a hostile environment. I was advised that I could file a court case but that it would be prudent to first give the company an opportunity to address the issue internally as the court should be a last resort.\n\nWith this in mind, I began to reach out to some of the women I had spoken to earlier. At this stage, I had been able to identify over five women who had also had inappropriate encounters with Daudi. Only one woman was willing to come forward if the Board could guarantee that she would remain anonymous. Some of the other women had no evidence of their allegations and thus did not expect to be believed. Others did not want to be associated with something so potentially scandalous or to rehash past traumatic events. It therefore took about three more weeks to get my ducks in a row and submit the complaint to the board; I did that on 4th May 2017.\n\nSee this timeline for what transpired since.\n\nSince then, I have heard terrible stories from a total of eleven women who have told me about having similar unpleasant encounters with Daudi, in addition to another ten or so stories that I\u2019ve been unable to verify. The behaviour told of in these stories varies from inappropriate and\/or suggestive text messages to sending of pictures of male genitalia and pornography. In one incident Daudi allegedly exposed his genitals to a woman in the middle of a conversation about her work.\n\nViewed against this grim picture, I feel as if I got off lightly. And, in the larger spectrum of harassment that encompasses physical assault and even sexual assault, it is easy to dismiss what happened to me as trivial. Except that it is not. I\u2019ve actually had people tell me \u201cIt was only words so it\u2019s not a big deal \u2014 at least he didn\u2019t rape you.\u201d However, in my view, verbal harassment is not inconsequential; in addition to being traumatic, it is often the gateway to more grievous offences and thus should not be treated lightly or ignored.\n\nThe reason I did not come forward with my story earlier is because, under Kenyan law, it is not permitted to comment on matters currently before a court. In this case, I was advised that as a show of good faith I should uphold this convention and extend its application to the internal Ushahidi process, even though the convention does not apply because the internal process was not judicial. But now that the Ushahidi Board has suspended Daudi after finding him guilty of gross misconduct, and will issue him with a notice to show cause why his employment should not be terminated, I am of the view that I am finally free to speak and comment on this entire debacle.\n\nI have two main bones of contention. The first is Daudi\u2019s behaviour. Based on the additional allegations made via tweets and offline discussions that have occurred since the news of my complaint came to light on 9th July, it would not be a stretch to call Daudi\u2019s alleged behaviour predatory. Such predation is enabled by a culture of silence and secrecy that encourages victims of harassment to \u201cnot make a fuss\u201d or \u201cpersevere\u201d or \u201cjust ignore him until he gets tired or bored and goes away.\u201d This culture leads many, many victims to not call out predatory behaviour and report it as the violence it actually is. This culture feeds into the victims\u2019 fears that there is no point in speaking out against the harassment they face and leads them to feel like they have no option but to suffer in silence. This must stop! We cannot expect victims of harassment to speak up if they are (rightly) afraid that public opprobrium will follow.\n\nMy second bone of contention is the Board\u2019s response. I have been deeply let down by the actions and inaction of David Kobia, Erik Hersman, Juliana Rotich and Jenny Stefanotti. Ever since I lodged my complaint on 4th May, I have been subjected to all the negative repercussions that make victims of harassment afraid to speak out:\n\nLack of support: Over the 74 days of this ordeal, not a single board member has reached out to inquire about my well being in any way, shape or form. Not a phone call, not an email, not through a third party. I shall repeat this again: nobody from Ushahidi leadership or the board has at any point bothered to ask if I\u2019m okay or sought to alleviate the adverse impact this has had on my work and health. The only person in management who displayed any concern is my supervisor who, even though he is my direct line manager, only found out about this when I informed him of my intention to leave Ushahidi on 19th June. The Board have claimed on several occasions that they refrained from enquiring about my well-being because they feared incurring legal liability. To the best of my knowledge, no laws prohibit a person from asking \u201chow are you?\u201d Anyone possessing some basic human decency should know \u2014 and do \u2014 better. Victim shaming: All through this process, I have been subtly censured by the Board for seeking and retaining legal counsel. The rationale is that I \u201cmade this legal and complicated\u201d by involving a lawyer which forced everyone else to lawyer up and thus led to the delays in handling the matter. This has been said to me personally by Erik Hersman and is a sentiment that has been repeated several times by other Board members, and their counsel in both private and public conversations. Slander: I have been reliably informed of more than one instance where Daudi has made comments to the effect that I am the one who pursued him for the purposes of establishing a sexual relationship and that I only filed a complaint when he rejected me. These comments were made to both colleagues and at project meetings with Ushahidi partners. I have tried to bring this up at least twice: once in the 24th May letter to the Board and subsequently at the internal hearing on 5th July. In the first instance, I received no response while in the second I was not even allowed to complete my question and was told that \u201cmy question is not relevant\u201d as these events occurred after my complaint was made and thus were not covered by the inquiry. Delays: It took 74 days to get a decision from the Board. Nothing except enthusiastic letter writing was done for the first 60 days. And even the letters from the Board\u2019s counsel seemed to be sent by literal snail mail \u2014 there was always a delay of 1 to 4 working days, and unlike the other lawyers they did not send advance copies of their letters via e-mail. The Board only seemed to act once the matter became public \u2014 first with Making All Voices Count followed then in various Kenyan WhatsApp groups, blogs and media. More happened in days 60\u201374 (15 days) than in the initial 60 days combined. An opaque process: Throughout the 74 days, and until now, I have had no clarity on how the board would handle this issue, save for the letter issued by the Board\u2019s advocates after the meeting of 20 June 2017 where the terms of engagement of the hearing were set out. At no point did the Board provide me with the timelines within which they intended to conclude this matter. They could have chosen to do this any way they wanted as the Ushahidi whistleblower policy is vague and only states \u201cThe Ushahidi\u2019s Compliance Officer will notify the person who submitted a complaint and acknowledge receipt of the reported violation or suspected violation. All reports will be promptly investigated and appropriate corrective action will be taken if warranted by the investigation.\u201d And even when a process was outlined, it was not as advertised. For instance, the inquiry that the board held was framed as a \u201cconversation to try and establish what happened and seek clarification\u201d but in my view, the \u201cconversation\u201d quickly degenerated to my being subjected to over 2.5 hours of brutal questioning designed not to get at the truth but to create an alternative narrative where the perpetrator became the victim. Even the 27-page Inquiry Report on this process ends with a Notice To Show Cause that once again has no timelines or clarity on when the process will end. Character attacks: During the inquiry, I had several harmless and not so harmless personality flaws used against me. Because I have a potty mouth and used the word \u201cfuck\u201d during the incident, it was suggested that I am the one who turned the conversation to sex and thus invited Daudi\u2019s sexual overtures. This was despite the fact that I did not use the word in a sexual context (see this video for various uses of the word \u201cfuck\u201d). It was also implied that I actively welcomed Daudi\u2019s sexual proposition because I did not vociferously voice my protest at his inappropriate remarks but instead tried to change the subject. The refusal to listen to, let alone address my concerns: Throughout this process, I have been provided with no opportunity to openly air my concerns to the board or receive a response to them. The issues I raised in my letters, such as Erik asking Ushahidi staff to report any sexual harassment to management, including Daudi, were not addressed. Even at the hearing, I was not permitted to ask any questions \u2014 I was not even allowed to explain why I resigned!\n\nThe blame for what is arguably the mismanagement of this entire issue lies squarely with the Board. David Kobia, Erik Hersman, Juliana Rotich and Jenny Stefanotti need to jointly and severally take responsibility for this. Their failure to properly manage my complaint is the sole reason I resigned from a job I was very fond of and was very good at. Their failure to set out crystal clear parameters for the hearing allowed Daudi\u2019s counsel to turn it from an inquiry to a \u2018courtroom\u2019 with him as the prosecutor and the judge. Their failure to speak up or intervene as I was harangued for over 2.5 hours \u2014 even when my counsel objected \u2014 indicates that they found this acceptable.\n\nThey also lacked the independence to properly investigate and take action in this matter. This is evidenced by the following:\n\nPrevious knowledge of similar allegations: Daudi has a long history of allegations of sexually harassing women from his days in the Kenya Blogger Webring (KBW), which was active in the mid to late 2000s. What is even more horrifying is that at least three of the Board members have known about Daudi\u2019s alleged penchant for harassing women for a significant period of time. Juliana was an administrator at Kenya Unlimited as this was going on, while David Kobia was a co-founder and forum administrator at Mashada. Erik was also active online during this period and presumably was aware of these accusations. Even if he might not have heard of these allegations in the aughts, Erik Hersman was explicitly informed about allegations of sexual harassment against Daudi in late 2015 when a prominent Kenyan tech entrepreneur told him about them in November 2015. The allegations this time included sending unsolicited \u201cdick pics\u201d to women via DM on Twitter and making unwanted sexual advances to women within the Bishop Magua building (where Ushahidi, BRCK, GearBox and iHub were then located) and in the wider tech ecosystem. At this time Daudi was the acting Executive Director of Ushahidi Kenya. Despite all this knowledge, the Ushahidi Board made Daudi\u2019s Executive Director position permanent in January 2016. Furthermore, even when presented with unequivocal proof of gross misconduct, as I did when I made my complaint on May 4th 2017, the board had to be subjected to intense public pressure before they did anything meaningful. For over nine weeks after I lodged this complaint, Daudi continued to act in his capacity as Executive Director: he participated in project meetings, strategy sessions and even international travel as the face of the organisation, including attending the 2017 Advancing Good Governance seminar and the 6th Annual Luxembourg Peace Prize Awards. He was only sent on compulsory leave on the same day that Quartz Africa ran a story (12th July). All through this \u2018investigation\u2019, the Board has bent over backwards to accommodate the requests of Daudi and his lawyer. Initially, they asked for the same level of procedure as a criminal court (e.g. witness lists and sworn statements) without having the authority to do so. Later, they turned around and insisted that it was an internal investigation and thus should exclude evidence from sources outside the company. The Board acceded to Daudi\u2019s lawyer\u2019s demands, apparently because they were afraid of a wrongful termination suit being filed by Daudi. This is at best disingenuous and at worst malicious. A company with the ethos Ushahidi purports to have should not shy away from doing what is right for fear of a lawsuit. Besides, had Daudi sued Ushahidi, he\u2019d have effectively turned a private matter public as he would have had to declare why he was terminated. Court documents in Kenya are public documents: having my complaint and particularly that audio recording in the public domain logically went directly against his own best interests. Daudi\u2019s explanation for the events of the evening was that he lost an earpiece of his hearing aid and Erik, as well as the Aberdare staff, were helping him look for it. I then allegedly joined them without invitation and refused to leave him so all his statements were made in an effort to get rid of me. However, at the time of our conversation, Erik had already retired to bed for the night. This can be attested to by any of the Ushahidi Team Members who were still at the bonfire. During the hearing, Erik did not correct Daudi on this point and in so doing, indirectly corroborated that untruth. Even if Erik had been awake, the fact that he was called upon as part of Daudi\u2019s \u201calibi\u201d should have clearly demonstrated his lack of independence. Erik should not have been a part of the panel that the Board constituted to investigate and make a decision. One cannot be a witness and judge in the same case! To date, Daudi still has his job: From the board\u2019s latest update, Daudi has only been suspended. It is entirely possible that he may be reinstated in the company. This is despite the Board possessing audio evidence of him sexually harassing his junior as well as allegations from a plurality of victims which relate to multiple occurrences. Even with this, it still took public pressure for the Board to first send him on leave then suspend him. This is unacceptable. How are victims supposed to come forward if this is how a company with the reputation of Ushahidi handles these incidences?\n\nI\u2019ve received several explanations for the delay: The Board claims that this was a complex matter because Ushahidi is domiciled in the US, yet the employees are Kenyan and the incident occurred in Kenya. It really wasn\u2019t that complicated. Florida and Kenyan law are in sync when it comes to sexual harassment laws: we checked this before we submitted my complaint and even attached excerpts from both countries\u2019 laws.\n\nThe Board has also claimed that they were not able to action my complaint as quickly as they would have liked because they were trying to avoid a wrongful termination suit. As explained above this is insincere. Based on the speed of events from the 3rd of July, this could have been handled in 2 weeks. So why did it take 74 days? It seems clear that the board was looking for reasons not to act despite their verbal and written assurances to the contrary. In such a case, the will to act is all that matters. Not assumed best intentions. And based on their findings, Daudi is guilty of misconduct on several fronts. None of that was news and was obvious even before the 5th July Inquiry was held. This should not have taken as long as it did.\n\nAs detailed extensively above, for some mysterious reason the Ushahidi board and leadership has been reluctant to take action even when presented with clear evidence about Daudi\u2019s misconduct. This completely boggles the mind because this scandal poses an existential risk to Ushahidi as an organisation. The Nairobi grapevine was already buzzing with rumours of this complaint after it was made on 4th May. The board just seems to have gone out of its way to avoid dealing with my complaint.\n\nThe board has also been less than forthright in the following ways:\n\nClay Shirky left the Board of Ushahidi in October 2015. This was not announced internally nor externally. Up until 15th July, Clay was still listed on the website as a Board Member. The summary of the proceedings at the inquiry is dubiously interpreted, contains some outright misrepresentations as well as the omission of relevant sections. This can be borne out by the recording of said proceedings which the Board possesses and I invite them to share this recording in its entirety with the public. Internally, Ushahidi has an open door policy. However, it seems that this openness exists in spite of, and not because of the Board. Erik has invited the staff to report any incident of harassment assuring them that the Board will handle it swiftly. This assurance is solidly contradicted by how the Board has thus far treated the two staff members who were sexually propositioned on 19th January 2017, one of whom had evidence (myself) and one who did not. The Chronology of Events provided by the Board on 17th July is economical with the truth. Specific examples that demonstrate this are:\n\nThe failure to mention that I was travelling for work when I was unavailable on 31st May. This is information the Board had easy access to and should have taken into consideration when they proposed a date for the hearing.\n\nThe inaccurate description of the process of the giving of the evidence (5th to 15th June). See the timeline for what actually transpired, with an explanation for the delays.\n\nThe inaccurate description of the process of agreeing upon the terms of engagement to be used at the inquiry (20th and 27th June)\n\n5th July: At the hearing, the Board stated they needed a week to make their decision. This has now been revised to \u201c7 working days to communicate its decision\u201d\n\n\u201c5th July: The Board communicates its decision to send the Respondent on leave until a decision is made.\u201d It is not clear who they communicated that with. It certainly was not to me in the course of the hearing nor to the staff as I had access to e-mails until 10th July and this had definitely not been communicated to the team by then. Daudi was first sent on leave on 12th July after significant community and public pressure.\n\nAll in all, this complaint has been completely and utterly mismanaged from Day 1. Both the tech community and Kenyan society at large need to reject the terrible precedent that the Board of Ushahidi has set. Their process has been deeply flawed and this should not be ignored just because they have ostensibly come to the correct conclusion. In cases such as these, the means matter just as much as the end.\n\nHaving been on the wrong end of a poorly managed process, I would suggest that all organisations revisit their sexual harassment procedures and evaluate them in light of best practices. Specifically, they need to ensure that the following issues have been addressed:\n\nA well-articulated process should be described that covers:\n\nTimelines: The time taken for the entire process should be as short as possible. A maximum of 14 calendar days seems to be an acceptable global standard. The process to be followed: In what form and way should employees submit complaints or raise concerns? Are there alternate persons to whom employees can submit such complaints when the complaints are against the very person they are normally supposed to submit them to? Is evidence of a claim required? If yes, what kind? What each stage of the process will do, when it will be done and why. What form communication during the process will take and what each party should expect to hear \/ receive at each stage. Notification of other staff: Be explicit on what staff will be notified, when and in what form. Channel to raise concerns: A means should be created to allow all parties to raise any issues they have as the process is ongoing. Appeal process: if the outcome is not satisfactory to the parties, what if any avenues for recourse do they have?\n\nSupport to the parties: what, if any, psychological support are the victim and perpetrator entitled to? When and where is this support available, and for how long?\n\nLeave of absence during the investigation: If and for how long the victim and perpetrator should be sent on compulsory (paid) leave as the investigation process is undertaken.\n\nCommunication with the rest of the company and the outside world: A policy should exist on what is revealed, when and how to other staff as well as to parties outside the organisation.\n\nIt should go without saying it seems that it must be said: Sexual harassment is not a harmless or victimless crime. Because of it, I\u2019ve had to resign from a job I liked and was very good at. This has been detrimental to both the Programme, and the organisation as a whole. I know of people who have been forced to resign due to harassment and are subsequently unable to find new jobs and new sources of income. This is because at its core sexual harassment is about an abuse of power. The person in a position of power leaves the victim in a position where they either remain silent or lose their livelihood. We cannot be speaking of building inclusive workplaces for women (who bear the brunt of the majority of sexual harassment cases) when we are still contending with such rudimentary issues as ensuring that offices are free of harassment.\n\nBased on how effectively my complaint was bungled, Ushahidi\u2019s reputation has taken a massive hit. This need never have happened and is completely unfair to the majority of the staff of the organisation who have played absolutely no part in this series of unfortunate events, and to this day remain mostly in the dark about exactly what transpired. It breaks my heart that the good people who work at Ushahidi have been damaged by the actions of David Kobia, Erik Hersman, Juliana Rotich and Jenny Stefanotti. The good work that Ushahidi has done over the past 10 years, and continues to do should not be tarnished by the actions and lack thereof of this Board.\n\nIn order to begin the healing process within the company, and for the world to begin to regain confidence in Ushahidi, the Board should resign in its entirety. Only new management can begin to repair the damage done. There is a Swahili saying: \u201cMwenzako akinyolewa, na wewe tia maji\u201d. Current employees who have witnessed first hand how poorly I have been treated have very real fears about how their issues and concerns will be handled in the future. Only a fresh and independent Board and Executive Director can provide the assurances that the staff, the Kenyan tech community and the world at large need, as we all move on from here. A good first step would be to set up a Kenya HarassMap deployment and put aside some resources to pay for any legal and counselling support services to other victims of Daudi and other sexual predators.\n\nUshahidi is a great company with a valuable product. I hope the Board can put their egos aside and do what\u2019s best for the company, which is stepping aside to give Ushahidi a chance to rebuild its reputation.\n\nUpdate: Timeline updated on 21 July to correct typos and add a missing link"}
